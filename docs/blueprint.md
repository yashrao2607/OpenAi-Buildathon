## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#6A994E) to represent agriculture and nature. This provides a sense of grounding and connection to the earth, fitting for an app focused on farming. Avoid cliche by ensuring saturation is not excessive.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a very desaturated and bright variant of the primary green, creating a soft, neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Warm gold (#E2B714), an analogous hue to green, but significantly different in brightness and saturation; it represents the wealth generated from successful harvests and highlights key interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif providing a modern and neutral look for comfortable reading of market data and scheme details.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif giving a computerized and techy feel for the headers.
- Use clear, representational icons sourced from Google's Material Design icon set to ensure intuitive navigation and easy recognition of features.
- Implement a card-based layout to present information in a modular and digestible format, optimizing user experience on smaller mobile screens.
